# Title

MY PORTFOLIO REACT APPLICATION

## Description

A Single Page Application (SPA) React portfolio of work samples that may be presented to prospective employers in their assessment of me as a potential candidate for employment.

Output is based on the acceptance criteria outlined in the Module 20 Assignment Overview [Module-20-assignment](https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/1181/assignments/23390?module_item_id=466715).

## Installation

The React App is initiated by running "npm create-react-app"in the CLI and, once the sufficient coding has been added, may be deployed by typing "npm run start" in the CLI.  A webpage is then launched at "localhost:3000".

## Usage

This application enables the user to develop a platform in which that user's web development projects and related works may be presented to prospective employers in their consideration of that user for a potential job position.  The portfolio also features sections in which the user may add personal or other information that may be useful to share with prospective employers when seeking a position.

The main sections of the application are:

* About Me - a short bio about the owner of the portfolio.

* Portfolio - Images highlighting the applications featured in the portfolio along with links to their deployed URL (Heroku or GitHub) as well as their respective GitHub links.

* Resume - a resume summarizing the portfolio owner's work experience, education, skills and activities which may be useful in the search for employment.  The Resume also includes a link to a PDF version which may be opened and downloaded.

* Contact Form that may be used to contact the portfolio owner.  Below that is the Footer which includes links to the portfolio owner's LinkedIn account, GitHub account and facebook/Meta account (although this portfolio owner tries to avoid that last one when possible!).
